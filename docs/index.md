# CREXX
REXX Language Implementation

## News - 30 Sept 2020

After the successful presentation of CREXX concepts and plans to the 2020 REXX Symposium on Tuesday, and encouragement from Ren√© Jansen (President) and other members, including Mike Cowlishaw. We can announce that this project will start in earnest based on the work done to date (e.g. on BREXX/370) and the presented designs concepts.

Rene and I will be organising fortnightly ZOOM update calls.

The initial work is to confirm a common toolset (hopefully from including an IDE from JetBrains) that will provide an cross platform DevOps experience for contributors.

The first ZOOM call will discuss toolset and DevOps processes, and location of skeleton components.

I will be adding design assets to the repository over the next few days.
