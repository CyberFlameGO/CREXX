# CREXX

## REXX Language Implementation Architecture

Project to develop a modern ground up implementation of a REXX 
interpreter and compiler, and experiments with language improvements.
To implement REXX using the best language tools available 
today, including the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. These tools will 
allow a REXX compiler to be produced supporting multiple backends 
(including 64 bit architectures). 

One aspect of the project is to revisit the REXX language - what can be
improved? And most importantly how can it be improved while keeping the
essence of REXX:

> to make programming easier than before

And yes, CREXX will be targeted to run on VM/370 (a nod to its heritage)
and it will also run on Linux, Windows, OSX, and z/Architecture.
